# R analytics template

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of the R analytics template is to outline some default structure I used in my work that I find logical.

This serves as both a starting point when I start new work and a reference for others who want to interact with my work.

The intent is to gradually port many of the consistent functions that are currently stored here in a script and sourced, into standalone R packages.

## Installation

The package is just a collection of interconnected R scripts. They can be cloned straight from git into a folder.

However, for longer running work with more pieces, I'd strongly reccomend the scripts are separated into a scripts folder or area and then other artifacts of the anlaysis can be stored elsewhere.

This avoids clutter for more complicated work.
